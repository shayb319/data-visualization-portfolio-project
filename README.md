# Data Visualization Portfolio Project

 This project will explore the economic output and life expectancy of citizens from six different nations along with the relationship between economic output and life expectancy.
The goal of the project is to prepare the data, analyze the data through summary statistics and plots, and explain the findings from the study.

Here are some of the questions we would like to investigate and answer: 
 What is the distribution of life expectancy in these six nations? 
 What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
 Has GDP increased over time in these nations?
 Has life expectancy increased over time in these nations?
 Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
